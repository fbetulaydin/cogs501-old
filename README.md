COGS 501 - Formal Languages and Linguistics - METU 
-------------------------------------------------------

**Short description:** The course is an introduction to two foundational
concepts in cognitive science: structural representations and
computation. As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex
structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural
languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of
computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is
(based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and
representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of
talking about different *types* of structural relations; and (iii) that
bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive
scientific investigation of language.
